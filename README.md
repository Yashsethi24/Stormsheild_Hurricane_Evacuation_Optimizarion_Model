# StormShield: Hurricane Patient Evacuation Optimization Model

**StormShield** is an advanced integer programming-based optimization framework designed to enhance patient evacuation strategies during hurricanes, particularly for ICU patients in Florida. By leveraging data-driven insights including FEMA's National Risk Index, it balances patient safety, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. With StormShield, decision-makers can shift from reactive, last-minute evacuations to proactive, well-structured plans that minimize healthcare disruptions and save lives.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of evacuating patients from high-risk hospitals during hurricane events in Florida. The model optimizes the allocation of emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles to efficiently transport patients from high-risk to safe hospitals while considering multiple objectives:

- **Maximize patient evacuation** (highest priority)
- **Minimize environmental pollution** (medium priority) 
- **Minimize operational costs** (lower priority)

## üìä Key Results

The optimization model successfully generated an evacuation plan with the following outcomes:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Patients Evacuated** | 4,597 |
| **Total Cost** | $756,560.07 |
| **Total Pollution** | 1,518,528.62 pounds of CO‚ÇÇ |
| **Maximum Evacuation Time** | 96 hours (4 days) |

### Vehicle Utilization Breakdown:
- **Ambulances**: 177 vehicles ‚Üí 1,609 patients
- **Air Ambulances**: 32 vehicles ‚Üí 32 patients  
- **Fire Ambulances**: 128 vehicles ‚Üí 1,196 patients
- **Buses**: 19 vehicles ‚Üí 1,760 patients

## üè• Data Sources & Processing

### Datasets Used:
1. **EMS Dataset**: Contains information about emergency medical services stations including:
   - Location data (coordinates, county)
   - Vehicle fleet information (ambulances, air ambulances, fire ambulances, buses)
   - Facility type and population served

2. **Hospital Dataset**: Includes details about hospitals in the region:
   - Location and capacity information
   - ICU patient counts
   - Bed availability and vacancy rates

3. **Hurricane Dataset**: Provides hurricane risk information:
   - FEMA's National Risk Index data
   - Hurricane frequency and risk scores by county

### Data Processing:
- **Geographical Filtering**: Applied Florida boundary constraints (24.396308¬∞N to 31.000888¬∞N, -87.634938¬∞W to -80.031362¬∞W)
- **Risk Classification**: Hospitals classified as high-risk (‚â•98.0 risk score) or safe (<98.0 risk score)
- **Distance Calculations**: Used Haversine formula for accurate distance computations between locations

## üöó Vehicle Parameters

### Vehicle Types & Capacities:
- **Ambulance**: 2 patients, 55 mph, 4.9 MPG
- **Air Ambulance**: 1 patient, 160 mph, 39.63 gal/hour
- **Fire Ambulance**: 2 patients, 55 mph, 4.9 MPG  
- **Bus**: 20 patients, 40 mph, 7.0 MPG

### Operational Parameters:
- **Utilization Factor**: 50% of each vehicle type available for evacuation
- **Turnaround Time**: 30 minutes for ground vehicles, 1 hour for air ambulances
- **Staff Requirements**: 2 paramedics for ground vehicles, 1 pilot + 1 paramedic for air ambulances

## üßÆ Optimization Model

### Mathematical Formulation:
The model uses Gurobi optimization solver with the following key components:

#### Decision Variables:
- `u[e,r,v]`: Number of vehicles of type v from EMS station e to risky hospital r
- `x[r,s,v]`: Number of round trips by vehicle type v from risky hospital r to safe hospital s
- `z[r,s,v]`: Number of round trips made by vehicle type v from risky hospital r to safe hospital s

#### Key Constraints:
1. **Vehicle Capacity Limits**: EMS station vehicle availability constraints
2. **Flow Balance**: Conservation of vehicles between EMS stations and hospitals
3. **Time Constraints**: Maximum 96-hour evacuation window
4. **Patient Evacuation**: All ICU patients must be evacuated
5. **Safe Hospital Capacity**: Respecting destination hospital capacity limits

#### Multi-Objective Function:
1. **Primary**: Maximize number of evacuated patients
2. **Secondary**: Minimize environmental pollution (CO‚ÇÇ emissions)
3. **Tertiary**: Minimize total operational costs
