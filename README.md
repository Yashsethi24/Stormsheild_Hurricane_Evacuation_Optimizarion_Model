**StormShield: A Patient Evacuation Optimization Model**

StormShield is an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to enhance patient evacuation strategies during hurricanes, particularly for ICU patients. By leveraging data-driven insights (including FEMA's National Risk Index), it balances patient safety, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. With StormShield, decision-makers can shift from reactive, last-minute evacuations to proactive, well-structured plans that minimize healthcare disruptions and save lives.

The whole project was written in python and optimization was done using Gurobi.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files:

- `Optimization_code.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the StormShield optimization model
- `Stormsheild_Hurricane_evacuation_optimization_model.pdf`: Detailed documentation of the optimization model and methodology
- `MGSC_662-Stormsheild_model_presentation.pdf`: Presentation slides explaining the project and its findings

## Getting Started

To run the optimization model:
1. Ensure you have Python installed
2. Install required dependencies (Gurobi and other Python packages)
3. Open and run the `Optimization_code.ipynb` notebook

## Documentation

For detailed information about the model and its implementation, please refer to:
