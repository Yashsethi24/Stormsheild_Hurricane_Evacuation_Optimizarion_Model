**StormShield: A Patient Evacuation Optimization Model**

StormShield is an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to enhance patient evacuation strategies during hurricanes, particularly for ICU patients. By leveraging data-driven insights (including FEMAâ€™s National Risk Index), it balances patient safety, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness. With StormShield, decision-makers can shift from reactive, last-minute evacuations to proactive, well-structured plans that minimize healthcare disruptions and save lives.

The whole project was written in python and optimization was done using Gurobi.
